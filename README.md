# ScholarshipSprint - A Mobile Application
## Introduction
Scholarship Sprint was designed to help and improve the undergraduate student experience with searching and applying for scholarships. Through an extensive research process and iterative design process, Scholarship Sprint aims to eliminate problems posed in the current UCLA Financial Aid and Scholarship site and streamline the individualized search and application process that is involved when applying for grants and scholarships as an undergraduate student.

 has been crucial to exploring the problem space of the Financial Aid and Scholarship website, as well as other Bruin Resource Center sites.

## Low Fidelity Wireframes

Based on our user personas and journeys, highlighting potential pain points, we created low-fidelity wireframe sketches addressing elements for easy resource access.
